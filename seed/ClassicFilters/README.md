# ClassicFilters

## Description

Introducing Abschall's inaugural Daisy Seed project: Classic Filters, crafted upon the reliable 2nd order biquad structure.

This project features intuitive control knobs:
- *Cut-off Frequency:* Adjusts the cutoff frequency, ranging from 10 Hz to 24 kHz (half the sampling rate).
- *Q Factor:* Fine-tunes the Q factor for second-order filters, LPF2 and HPF2.
A selection toggle switch enables users to choose from four currently available filter types: LPF1, LPF2, HPF1, and HPF2.
